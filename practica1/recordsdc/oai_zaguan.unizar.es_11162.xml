Four diets in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement were used with two level of soluble fibre (89 vs.119 g/kg) and two level of threonine (5 vs. 6.4 g/kg).  Two experiments were conducted with rabbits weaned at 25 (35/diet) and 35 (32/diet) d of age to determine apparent ileal (at 35 and 46 d) and faecal digestibility, intestinal mucin concentration, mucosa morphology and growth traits. The increase of soluble fibre improved intestinal mucosa integrity and mucin secretion leading to a better health status of the rabbits when the sanitary conditions worsened. Mucosa barrier traits were not affected by dietary threonine level although in poor sanitary conditions a low threonine level impaired rabbit health suggesting a limiting status of this amino acid.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFM-2013-247</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:11162</dc:identifier><dc:date>2013</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

Through phonics instruction children develop decoding skills, however, reading and writing require other important skills. The Whole Language Approach´s principles refer to the use of context when reading, highlighting the importance of developing comprehension skills. A two-school comparison based in the Literacy skills required enables us to demonstrate that isolated phonics instruction is not sufficient. In this way, a proposal of improvements to reinforce Literacy instruction in an ELL context is presented in order to achieve a more effective teaching of reading and writing.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFG-2014-868</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:14990</dc:identifier><dc:date>2014</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

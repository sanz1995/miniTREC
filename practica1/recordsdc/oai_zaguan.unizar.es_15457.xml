Snow’s two-cultures debate and to uplift the realm of arts in the world of academia. Lodge manages to play with a large variety of narrative strategies that suit to perfection character types and ideas. In this dissertation I intend to analyse Thinks... as a contemporary campus novel and to explore its contribution to the debate between science and humanities, taking into account both the formal and thematic aspects of the novel.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFG-2014-1156</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:15457</dc:identifier><dc:date>2014</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

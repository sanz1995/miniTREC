The project considers both what is supposed to be taught in a second language classroom and also how it should be taught, always relating these reflections to literature on the issue and my own placement period experience.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFM-2014-208</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:14905</dc:identifier><dc:date>2014</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

As a genre, this kind of film has often been accused of promoting an old-fashioned notion of British identity, based on those Victorian values of the past. On the other hand, I believe that a close analysis of the films may reveal a certain degree of criticism of the past as well as traces of dissatisfaction with the present, especially in terms of ethnic and gender relationships. Hence, what I try to demonstrate, or rather explore, is the presence of different discourses in these productions, their complexity and ambivalence and their cultural importance in both reflecting and constructing – or  refracting – the social reality of their historical context. </dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TESIS-2009-057</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:3260</dc:identifier><dc:date>2009</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

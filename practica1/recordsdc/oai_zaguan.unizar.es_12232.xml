A search for observational studies was carried out using database Pubmed in May 2013. Of 278 potentially eligible papers, 34 papers were included. Most studies (28/34; 82%) were crosssectional and all used proxies for adiposity, such as body mass index (BMI) or BMI z-score as the outcome measure. Few studies (9%; 3/34) focused on pre-school children. There was consistent evidence of negative associations between pedometer-determined physical activity and adiposity: significant negative associations were observed in 24/34 (71%) of studies overall. The present review supports the hypothesis that higher levels of habitual physical activity are protective against child and adolescent obesity. However, prospective longitudinal studies are warranted; there is a need for more research on younger children, and for more ‘dose-response’ evidence.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFM-2013-757</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:12232</dc:identifier><dc:date>2013</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

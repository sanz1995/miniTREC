Properties regarding the use of this uncertainty criterion in the active SLAM context are highlighted, and comparisons against the A-optimality criterion and entropy are presented. This report shows that contrary to what has been previously reported in the literature, the D-optimality criterion is indeed capable of giving fruitful information as a metric for the uncertainty of a robot performing SLAM. Finally, through various experiments with simulated and real robots, we support our claims and show that the use of D-opt has desirable effects in various SLAM related tasks such as active mapping and exploration.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFM-2011-102</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:6663</dc:identifier><dc:date>2011</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

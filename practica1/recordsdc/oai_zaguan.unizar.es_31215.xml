Any language is bound to suffer dialect variation within its grammar, lexis, and pronunciation and Great Britain is not an exception. There was a time in the UK when differences were at their peak. That happened during the Middle English period. The main issue of this paper is to comment on the most relevant differences within two great dialectal areas of Great Britain –North and South– by focusing on two texts from that period, specifically, from the 14th century. Therefore, the differences shown are a matter of geography, rather than chronological. Each text –the Northern manuscript The Bee and the Stork and the Southern text Ayenbite of Inwyt– has been analyzed both syntactically and morphologically in order to find out the most remarkable differences between them. This paper concludes with an explanation of the most relevant differences according to dialect and their gradual homogeneity as a consequence of the development of Standard English in the 15th century.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFG-2014-2536</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:31215</dc:identifier><dc:date>2014</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

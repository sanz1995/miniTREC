Among the thousands of soldiers who experienced the living in the trenches there was the English author John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973), known for being the creator of works such as The Hobbit (1937) or The Lord of the Rings (1954), as well as the secondary world of Middle Earth. The following dissertation, ‘Literary and Contextual influences in JRR Tolkien’s works’ deals with both the biographical facts that Tolkien experienced, focusing mainly on his presence in World War I, as well as his education received at the University of Oxford, in which he learnt and appreciated the classics of literature and also developed a peculiar interest in philology and languages. In order to support the ideas exposed regarding his influences, several extracts from his main works will be analyzed and put in consideration with the help of secondary readings from scholars quite versed in Tolkien’s criticism.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFG-2014-1811</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:31221</dc:identifier><dc:date>2014</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

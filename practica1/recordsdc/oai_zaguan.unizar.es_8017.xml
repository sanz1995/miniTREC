I propose making use of ICTs to assess students and make them responsible of their own learning by integrating technology. In this respect, I would not conduct grammatical tests at the end of term or at the end of year. I believe students must be taught new assessment and evaluation processes. Teachers have to explain that not having a final test does not mean that expectations or class demands are going to be lower. Teachers must also motivate their students, provide constant feedback and design personalised assessment plans.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFM-2012-143</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:8017</dc:identifier><dc:date>2012</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

It is divided into three main sections. First of all I make some reflections about my process of learning in each course. Then, in the second section, I present and self-assess the sub-competences I acquired in each module and I present through a summarizing chart the main competences of the Master I have achieved at the end of that section. I will synthesize my innovation research project in the third part, and I will finish by explaining the importance of my future permanent training, putting forward some of the ways of developing it.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFM-2012-010</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:6830</dc:identifier><dc:date>2012</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

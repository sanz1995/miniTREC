Since application of MMMs in liquid separation is not well discovered yet, the prepared MMMs were applied in dehydration of alcohol via pervaporation. In particular, the mixture of interest was water/ethanol solution due to its azeotropic composition and therefore difficulties in separation. Ordered mesoporous silica spheres of different sizes and various types of MOFs were introduced into a polymer matrix at different loadings in order to study the effect of the fillers on membrane performance.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFM-2013-226</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:11136</dc:identifier><dc:date>2013</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

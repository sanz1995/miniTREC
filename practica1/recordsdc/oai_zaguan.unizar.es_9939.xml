However, it is obvious that the development of large area neutron detectors based on alternative neutron converters is rapidly becoming a matter of urgency. In the technique presented, grids each comprising 30  10B4C layers (each 1 µm thick) are used to convert neutrons into ionising particles which are subsequently detected in proportional gas counters. Several prototypes, the largest with a total active area of 8 cm x 200 cm, were tested. Up to 4.6 m2 of  10B-enriched boron carbide were coated onto aluminium blades using a DC magnetron sputtering machine. Characterisation of the prototype showed neutron efficiency to be n = 53.04% for 2.5 A neutrons, which is in line with expectations from MC simulation. Gamma-sensitivity = 5 · 10-5 was measured for a broad range of energies. Long term stability measurements were also performed. These results demonstrate the potential of this technique as alternative to 3He-based position sensitive detectors.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza, Prensas de la Universidad</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TESIS-2013-009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:9939</dc:identifier><dc:date>2012</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

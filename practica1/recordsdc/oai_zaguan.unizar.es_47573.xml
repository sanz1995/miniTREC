At present, this element is expensive due to use for a few years ago. According to navigation criteria and types of boats in the market, has opted for the realization of a polyvalent bowsprit because can be installed in most sailboats. It will perform a study market of such booms to acquire information and to see if we can offer this product range to other sizes of sailboats, for smaller boats, in addition to a simple and cheap product to bring production the first units to be manufactured. A prototype will be made in the workshop.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFG-2015-2490</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:47573</dc:identifier><dc:date>2015</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

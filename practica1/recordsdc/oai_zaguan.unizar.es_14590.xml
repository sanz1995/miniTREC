The investigation has been carried out in four schools which follow two different teaching methodologies. This has enabled us to analyze how the use of a certain teaching methodology or strategy influences the communicative competence in English and the ease with which the language is spoken. The analysis of the data gathered has led us to the proposal of improvements to make the teaching of English more effective.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TAZ-TFG-2014-700</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:14590</dc:identifier><dc:date>2014</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>

Analysis and assessment of operation strategies. </dc:title><dc:description>The predictive system developed in this Thesis has the same structure as the so-called combustion kinetics models, however, it obtains the fluid and thermal description through CFD simulations.  To solve the handicap of the high computational cost needed to run a CFD simulation, a neural network system is used to reproduce the solutions given by the CFD code.  Moreover, a neural network system permits to interpolate in the range of variation used during the training stage, and thus, a predictive system covering the whole operational range of the plant is obtained. </dc:description><dc:publisher>Universidad de Zaragoza</dc:publisher><dc:identifier>TESIS-2009-065</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zaguan.unizar.es:3360</dc:identifier><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc>
